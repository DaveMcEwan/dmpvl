A Condensed Checklist for Engineering Changes
=============================================

These are 6 steps which can be followed to ensure each piece of engineering
work is developed with clarity.
In every step it is essential to pause and reflect for a moment before moving
on: *Is there anything I could improve upon thus far?*


1
: **Explain the pros/cons** of different approaches.

2
: **Describe the changes** you will make in your preferred approach.

3
: **Make the changes**, i.e. modify source code.

4
: Explain how others can **repeat your checks** and what they should  expect.

5
: **Describe the limitations** of your changes.

6
: **Provide a history** of how the work progressed.

Materials from the middle steps are increasingly formal, with source code being
completely formal.
The formallity is related to how much effort you should demonstrate, i.e.
"make the changes" is only a small item in the middle.
From your colleagues' perspective, the most important thing is the visibility
of the care and effort that you have put into understanding the problem and
producing a well-considered solution.

You can, and should, reach out to your colleagues for assistance at any point
that you don't understand something.
It is important to keep notes which you can refer back to, both when you're
doing your own work, and when receiving guidance/assistance from others.
